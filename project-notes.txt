- component is represent the user interface.
- Main component: header,sideBar,mainBody,footer and this all have in main component(App).  Total is 5 component.
- component is the reusable.we use reuse with the new property and new imformation.

-Its component reused
2) React Declairative.
- what is Declairative : what u want just tell here and react made its way.
ex: when you tell to painter please make landscape they create that own way.

2) propes
- why we use propes we are use reuse componeted in main component(App) so in wvery time the data are same comming like Hello kamal so your are use same component 3 time then hello kamal come three time so that time the PROPS help us.

3) div
- we use div for multiple return html tab store in div and then only one div tab we return in component.(group)

4)softwares :
vscode,node,js,postman.

5)Hooks:
- we use state wihout writing the class.

6)JSX(javascript XML):
- extaintion to the javascript systex.
- write XML : elements and components.
- jsx makes easy and elegant code.
- jsx diff is keyword like(class-> className , for-> htmlFor , camleCase (  onclick -> onClick,tabindex -> tabIndex))

7)props and states
 - props:                                               states:
    - propes pass to the component.                     - state is managed within the components.
    - passed into the function.                          - variable declaire in the function body.
    - props are immutable.                               - state can be changed.
    - props - for function component.                              - useState Hook - for function component 
    - this.props - for class component.                            - this.state - for class component.   

8) Event handle in react
- we tried the function event and class event>
- refer = function event: FunctionClick.js , class event : ClassClick.js

9) Method as props
- parentComponent and Childcomponet file refer

10)Event handle
- refer EventHandler.js file

11)Conditional Rendering
- if/else 
- Element variable
- Ternary Conditional operator
- Short circuit operators 
refer : UserGreeting.js

12)List Rendering
- refer : NameList.js

13)react hook : use setState Hook
- class hook : classCounter.js
- function hook,how to use sta  te hook into react : hookCounter.js 
- Learn : Rules of react Hooks

14)Destructuring
- Destructur props and state : Destructuring.js

15)Basic form Handling(part 21)
-controlled the component
- syntex understand:

16)lifecycle method(Part:22)
- Mounting
- UpDating
- UnMounting
- Error Handling

 17)Mounting = part:23
- what is constructor :aa tyare call thase jayare new component create karie.
- what is super() : this is a special method after define we used this.props directly.
- constructor -> static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state) -> render():this is only for class component 

18)lifecycle:
- part:24
- Discuss update component lifecycle

19)Fragments 
- part:25
- WHY WE USE DIV<> TAG MUST IMPOTANT.
- React.Fragment
- Understanding with example table and columns file

20)Component and Pure-Component in React
- Part : 26
- what is shallow comparison(SC)
- primitive and complex type
- primitives : shallow comparison means same type and same value
- complex : same type same value with same reference obj like a===a
- component : every time re-render.
- pure-component : when should component update that time its render.only work with class component.
- if you want same result in function refer part : 27 memo

21) Memo : part: 27
- this is only for function component

22)refs : part:28
- inputtype tag we focus on input value on refresh
- focus
- value
- ref with function

23) ref with class part:29
- if you use parent to child no working ref in function only work with class
- focus cursor

24)ref forwarding Part:30
- automatically pass a ref component to one of its childer.
- file name:FRInput.js
- parent button na button par click karish to child na input par focus thase.

25)React Portal part:31
- add div id = "portal-app"
- PortalDemo.js

26)Error handling phase method part:32
-staticGetDerivedStateFromError(error)
-componentDidCatch(error,info)
- Hero.js , ErrorBoundry.js
- Proper Error handling UI for refer this video

27)Higher order components part:33(part:1)
- withCounter.js

28)context : 
part:38
- app in have comp C -> C comp have E -> E comp have F.
its like nested component calling.
